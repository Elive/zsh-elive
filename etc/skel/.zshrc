# To source the confs from /etc allows you to obtain fixes and improvments to your shell by upgrading the related packages, however you can copy the file locally to your home and source it instead, but we suggest to keep the things as how they are set.
#
# comment it if you want to use your own copy of prezto (not recommended, since we forked/modified it for a better elive experience)
ZDOTDIR="/etc/zsh"
#
# get the optimal default elive confs
source /etc/zsh/zshrc.elive.zsh
